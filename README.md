# Convolutional Neural Network
## Summary
Building a CNN model and fine tunning a VGG model on Jena flowers dataset from Harvard Data Verse. Data preparation can be the most challenging part, organising the data according to the labels can take time. In this repository i have arranged codes with respect to the steps to be followed. Data Preprocessing(in this case data augmentation) helps reduce the overfitting. Both the models are compared on the basis of accuracy.
## Steps Followed:
Import Library, Data Prearation, Data Preporcessing, Model Building, Fit a model, plot errors and compare results
## Data source:
"https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/QDHYST" Flower images of 30 wild-flowering angiosperm species found on semi-arid grasslands around the city of Jena in Germany. Classes are represented by 11 to 70 images with a total of 1,479 images.
